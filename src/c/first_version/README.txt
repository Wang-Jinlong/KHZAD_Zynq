These are files of version 1.0 of the project, ECB only implementation.
(Only the files that were altered in version 2.0 are included here.)
You can reuse these files to recreate the design for ECB only implementation, 
or for implementation of different block cipher modes of operation by 
wrapping the KHAZAD IP differently.
